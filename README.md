The module features a mountain cliff at the back of the module, with a siding
on track 2 that curves along the cliff.  The turnouts at the ends of the siding
are controlled by a LCC board.  Both turnouts are protected by signals that are
also managed by LCC board.  There is a small town at the front center of 
the module that includes an automatic  level grade crossing protected by 
lights and gates.  In the town is a pool hall with an automated lighted sign,

Up on the mountain cliff is a highway that includes a bridge over the back of 
the town and siding.  Also along the highway is a motel with a lighted sign
and a modern gas station / mini-mart with a lighted text-base sign, displaying
gas prices and other information.
